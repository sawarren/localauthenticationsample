# localauthenticationsample

The Local Authentication framework is one that I have personally enjoyed as a user. I think this feature adds a lot of value from a UX standpoint, since the vast majority of users know exactly what to do the instant they see the dialog.

This coding sample contains:
- Logging a user into an application with TouchID 
- Accessing Secure Keychain Items with TouchID (storage, retrieval and deletion)
